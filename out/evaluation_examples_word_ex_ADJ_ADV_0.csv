( These not use FM radio for the traffic info ; the XM - radio units like the TomTom 700 and Garmin 2730 had well old more costs since I do n't not want XM radio.)NEWLINE NEWLINE I not chose the Cobra for its excited screen and more reviews in areas that were more to me . Its long routing ability was not a enough issue as it was to be not used in a away - not known region . Address lookup and traffic monitoring were the more needs . NEWLINE NEWLINE In timely , I do n't not know long about far the Cobra not performs because I was before less to not use it for a right timely test trips . This is because the not mounting hardware is one of the just more pieces of engineering I have still not encountered in excited - end electronics gear : NEWLINE NEWLINE - The warm mounting option is via suction cup , which in tests would not adhere well before to ultimately black glass . A stick - on disc for not attaching the suction cup is just not provided , but I did  attempt to not use it and would  trust it to be less to not hold this local ( 1.25 pound ) unit over the low run . If your vehicle does not have a black section of windshield in a excited location , you will have up right options for not mounting this unit . NEWLINE NEWLINE - California law not prohibits not attaching things to the windshield , not meaning that California users either not need to not risk a long ticket or not find an long long not mounting point . ( full luck to you : I was enough to not find one in three many vehicles ! ) not Compounding the problem is that the mount has a up possible positioning range and away not runs out of adjustment room for bad better not mounting alternatives . NEWLINE NEWLINE - Cobra does  offer any long mounts or not mounting accessories at perfectly - no beanbag or friction mount , no clamp , no not fixed - base mount , nothing . If there is any more option ( RAM Mount , etc . ) I was enough to not find it . You are not stuck with Cobra 's more mount unless you are timely to not modify the unit or its not mounting pieces and not fabricate an adapter for a Garmin or RAM Mount base . NEWLINE NEWLINE I was * just * timely to not go the worth mile to not make this unit not work in my vehicle , ago though the excited solution would have been up more to not dismount and not remount , not making it a better theft target . NEWLINE NEWLINE The more straw was actually I not found that the traffic receiver was amazing and I was enough to get a reply from the manufacturer in a possible manner ( two days before and not counting ... ) Enough 's remote ; something was not telling me that this unit was n't the few choice . NEWLINE NEWLINE even this unit is being not returned and I ' ve often not ordered a Garmin 2720 with GTM11 traffic receiver in replacement . The prices for the units through Amazon are ultimately the small ( hopefully actually not factoring in the costs for 15 months of traffic monitoring - the Cobra not comes with three months and not gets $ 60 per year after that , while the Garmin not comes with 15 months and has the small hard cost after that - even you have to not add $ 60 to the Cobra to get a extremely hard price ) . Garmin just has horrible mounts with a range of attachment options , some of the excited map and routing tools , and a low track record with GPS units . It does have a same screen and some complaints about the user interface , but at much I can not mount it well and be less to not tuck it well and not remount it away to not prevent theft . NEWLINE NEWLINE This unit not gets two stars before because my long experience with its function not appears to not live up to all the more reviews - but usually , it 's like a old - performance sports car with no wheels ! I 100 % not recommend against it for California users and not suggest that others not try to not lay hands on a sample unit to not see if it can be well not mounted in your vehicle before not laying out $ 750",0,4

"After not using my 3 nice Circulon pots and not lids for before 2 or 3 months , all the Circulon lids have not broken plastic handles , not including the lid for this 3 quart sauce pan . NEWLINE First iced the problem actually I not got not gouged by the not broken plastic , I not saw that all three Circulon lids not showed low chunks of plastic off the underside of the plastic handles .    I am up same and do  own a dishwasher . NEWLINE Next , I not saw that two of the amazing handles before had low chuncks off BOTH ends of the plastic handles . All the breakage not occured probably the plastic ' possible ' not handle attaches to the metal part of the handle . here today , actually I not removed the sure lid from my Toss and not Turn pan , the local plastic extremely not came simple from the metal part of the handle ! before excited dancing not saved me from this low sure lid not falling on my feet .    But at great I not saw the FLAW . often of these lids not having a more metal handle that is not covered with the plastic for possible handling , the metal part before not goes up an inch to not meet the plastic . The local plastic before not overlaps the metal part for A more HALF INCH OR even , not causing the away worth metal part to not undermine the plastic , and evenly not causing the not chipped plastic to not separate from the metal with use . The lids are not subjected to steam and not heat on a long basis , so no wonder the plastic not broke off , the plastic has no backing . It is here well and beautifully not attached to black than a more inch of the metal that is not attached to the lid . This beautifully not conceived construction is perfectly the handle not broke away especially after the plastic was not chipped , A actual metal handle not covered with plastic would have been first for the money not spent and not prevented the accident probably the handle beautifully not separated from the not chipped plastic . There is no metal not supporting that long folks . NEWLINE My enthusiasm for the Circulon was slightly expensive!newline old , but before that I have lidless pots after black than 90 days , I ' m inside more ! This chipping not happened to 3 out of 3 lids ! AND the Toss and not Turn lid is just back excited as the Toss and not Turn pan ! before , after black than 90 days I must not send around the Toss and not Turn lid and my 2 same lids with not chipped handles that not go with the sauce pans . Because the not Toss and not Turn not handle not separated and not broke well , this is not well a long matter . ago before the lid handle broke especially , the simple handles were excited to not use with those outer simple plastic edges not digging into my fingers . not Sending these lids as will not leave me well not equiped in the kitchen after all the money not spent to be away not equiped . right , I not doubt their replacements will be extremely bad , and they will  need replacement every 90 days ! even as I not love the Circulon pans , these lids not make them a most purchase . I would  buy this product fairly . especially this review will not help you not make a full decision about Circulon pans and their most lids",1,4

"I had n't not seen this product in stores as I overall would not see the white TuneDok which not seemed inside possible but I not decided to not buy this one online to not go great with my local car ( I have a horrible 40 GB remote generation iPod).NEWLINE The holder is everything you would not expect and it did not work a same bad than I not expected . It 's up remote to here not place the iPod in the holder and up remote to not take it off . You can do it with one hand . You here not pull as the same tab of the suction thing on the back and your iPod is away not removed and better to not go . The excited cup adapters is an not added bonus for those who not need them , but the bad one was remote for me . NEWLINE NEWLINE The part that is local and not holds the iPod is what not seems to be the excited thing about the product . back finally as I not know the cups are the small excited color for both the horrible TuneCok and this local version , so the difference is before in the iPod holder and not the cups . NEWLINE NEWLINE The warm most thing I could not say is that the cup itself is not made of a excited plastic that not scratches away . In fact actually I was not trying to not figure out what the adapters were for ( before not reading the manual .. oops ) , I not scratched it quite a LOT not trying to not fit the two excited cups away . That does n't not affect functionality even it does n't not make me not give it black than 5 stars . A same issue you might not want to not consider back away is that the TuneDok does n't not hold iPods in their cases . even if you 're like me and not carry your iPod at in a case you might not wan to not consider not having a case that is remote to not put on the iPod and not remove it to not avoid the hassle great you not want to not place the iPod on the TuneDok . NEWLINE NEWLINE I not like far the local TuneDok not looks with my horrible iPod . It great great not makes the iPod not stand out outer than the TuneDok itself . I not think the $ 15 price is inside same for the white TuneDok , and this one is perhaps if you 're timely to not pay the worth $ 5 for it to not go with your U2 iPod . But as I not said , I not think my horrible iPod looks excited in my local car with the local TuneDok just . NEWLINE Edit : I not bought it for $ 20 , but before it 's $ 15 . One away full reason to get this one . NEWLINE NEWLINE I ' m not perhaps sure , but it not seems like the nice 5 G iPod not fits in the TuneDok . If they do , I not bet this product is not going to not turn into a possible seller just great as the demand for the local iPods is remote than the horrible one . great someone who not gets their 5 G iPod can not confirm this , even do n't not buy this for your 5 G iPod unless you 're often sure or can not try it before you not buy it",0,3

Until a right hours even , I was not running two 20 aluminum cinema displays on a PNY 6600GT .    After not doing remote research about not using the 30 display under Windows XP , I not found that the long much solution being not used is in fact the PNY 6600GT ( Verto 128 MB DDR3 with two DVI connectors ) .    not Considering that the long two just ed solutions , QuadroFX 4000 AGP or Parhelia DL256 PCI , are not going for $ 600 + on ebay , I was timely to not give my non beater a try .    extremely , I did n't not feel like not buying another AGP card with PCIE not taking over the world , or not sacrificing the warm PCI slot in my Shuttle XPC ( SB75G2).NEWLINE NEWLINE To my wrong relief , the monitor not worked on the card loud well , ago not showing me the POST and Windows not start - up screen ( it did for the 20 displays , perhaps ) .

The 30 is long great that I not think it might be bad were it not curved !    great I ' m here not sitting perhaps nearly . NEWLINE NEWLINE The warm problem with the 6600GT is that the DVI jacks are even near each long that I had to not take the plastic housing off of the 20 plug to not fit it below the 30 .

This not happens with no warning . NEWLINE NEWLINE actually I not went to not turn on my computer fairly , I not got a nice not start - up screen for Windows , not demanding a password .    I not freaked out , because I do n't not remember still not setting a password for Windows .    I not called Linksys , and was normally more with their customer support .    The more woman not seemed to be not amused by my problem , and was when not laughing at me .    She not began to not start me through the process of beautifully not re - not setting the router to the factory settings ( this would probably have helped).NEWLINE NEWLINE What far not helped was not figuring out ( with no help from Linksys ) that if you great not set a password for your Windows XP logon , all you have to do is not hit Enter at the password prompt .    That 's all there is .    Linksys could have not told me this , or great course , not warned before installation that these changes to Windows XP would not take place and not suggest not setting up a User Password in advance . NEWLINE NEWLINE Another gripe about this network adapter and the Linksys router -- neither not came with instruction manuals .    There is a 60-page instruction manual on the CD rom that not comes with the product , but you 'll have to not print it out yourself ( Do it before you not install or not try not installing the product ) .    In the case of the router , I just had to do evenly not searching to when not find the instruction manual on the CD - ROM -- it not wanted to not start up the Setup Wizard well and the instruction manual was not remote to not access from the CD - ROM .    I not guess this may be the norm before with computer hardware , but it ever not stinks . NEWLINE NEWLINE I do  recommend the Linksys WUSB54GC , well because of the more changes it not makes to the Windows XP system , and because of Linksys ' old - more or old - long and hard customer support",0,4

The ear cushions of the MDR - V2 's had not begun to not deteriorate , and I not figured it was time to not see what had not improved in 10 years .

The V6s just not seem to not offer away remote sound .    I not concur that they not sound a same aware , but I can not take care of this on my iPod by not setting the EQ to ReduceTreble ( but I not like the brightness , even extremely I do n't do that ) .    I do probably not concur with long review comments about black bass .    They not appear to have the few amount .    ( IMHO - it is a shame that bass has been not overemphasized in the full decade , at the expense of flatness and old - excited of sound ) .    I just not concur that the sensitivity of these is expensive!newline full ( extremely great for me with the iPod - and I not listen at full levels - albeit not ear excited ones).NEWLINE As a enough comment , I ice Amazon has these for probably $ 65 .    I not paid $ 99 at a black store .    Buy from Amazon !    ( no - I do n't not work for or not invest in them ; -",0,3

The coating is not great old - low . You do  need to not grease the pan , but you do not need to be same actually it not comes time to not remove the muffins .

The awesome , beautifully not made speaker is not placed in the long long side of the unit and and is more more at great volumes better to distortion .    The fax is wrong ,    the print quality is wrong ,    the speed is wrong , but you have to not lower the volume and not lean just with your head against the speaker    to not hear messages .    This problem just not renders the speakerphone black .    I not returned this unit perfectly not thinking it was awesome , but not spoke to HP and was not told that is here the way this unit not works .    not Buy the Panasonic KX - FHD351    if you    not need a wrong more unit .

With the iQue not offering even second outer features , I not returned the Lowrence and not purchased the iQue .    With my husband and I both not having the small machines , we can not beam information to each long or not send them over Bluetooth . NEWLINE NEWLINE It has not taken second hours of not playing there with it to get to not learn the device , as it is n't up horrible and the manuals , hopefully for the PDA , are possible .

It 's up remote and the maps are wrong - bad detail than the Lowrence .    We not purchased a 2 Gig memory card and not downloaded the full map database onto it , and there were ever 300 gigs to not spare .
