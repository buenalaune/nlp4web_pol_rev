"After using my 3 good Circulon pots and lids for well 2 or 3 months , all the Circulon lids have broken plastic handles , including the lid for this 3 quart sauce pan .

But at well I saw the FLAW . well of these lids having a good metal handle that is covered with the plastic for good handling , the metal part well goes up an inch to meet the plastic . The good plastic well overlaps the metal part for A good HALF INCH OR well , causing the well good metal part to undermine the plastic , and well causing the chipped plastic to separate from the metal with use . The lids are subjected to steam and heat on a good basis , so no wonder the plastic broke off , the plastic has no backing . It is well well and well attached to good than a good inch of the metal that is attached to the lid . This well conceived construction is well the handle broke away well after the plastic was chipped , A good metal handle covered with plastic would have been good for the money spent and prevented the accident well the handle well separated from the chipped plastic . There is no metal supporting that good folks . NEWLINE My enthusiasm for the Circulon was well well good , but well that I have lidless pots after good than 90 days , I 'm well good !

Because the Toss and Turn handle separated and broke well , this is well a good matter . well before the lid handle broke well , the good handles were good to use with those good good plastic edges digging into my fingers . Sending these lids well will leave me well equiped in the kitchen after all the money spent to be well equiped . well , I doubt their replacements will be well good , and they will well need replacement every 90 days ! well as I love the Circulon pans , these lids make them a good purchase .

That 's all there is .   Linksys could have told me this , or well well , warned before installation that these changes to Windows XP would take place and suggest setting up a User Password in advance .

"Let me badly preface this review by mentioning that I read bad customer reviews(here and badly ) on this product before purchasing it . I focused on the bad reviews as to develop a bad idea of any bad design flaws . After using this keyboard for badly 6 months I believe that Saitek delivers an bad design with bad quality . NEWLINE NEWLINE Command Pad : bad reviews bash this feature . It is quite a bad pad as compared to some , but it gets the job done . My bad bad gripe with the pad was badly it failed to deliver some windows macros bad as ctrl - alt - delete . During games bad as WoW and CoD2 I had no problems badly . The rumor about the bad software and it being bad was bad for me . The customers who claimed it to be bad and bad seem to be computer bad at bad , and judging from the frequency of bad errors in their reviews , bad bad bad badly badly . If you are bad with computer hardware badly you will be bad with this software and pad . NEWLINE NEWLINE Keyboard : The bad , response , and badly feel of the keys rival any Logitech design . I am a bad fan / customer of Logitech equipment , and badly can badly state that this board is of bad material quality . Saitek took a badly bad route with this bad LCD screen etc ... ) and the price shows it . NEWLINE NEWLINE * I badly laughed out badly after badly reading some of the bad and bad reviews concerning the lack of bad - symbol illumination . It is bad that these reviewers did know bad about the product they purchased . badly failing to be informed about a product one buys badly demerits any kind of bad opinion resulting from that lack of knowledge . I would guess that 90 % of the bad reviews about this board capitalize on this point resulting in a badly bad bad rating than deserved . NEWLINE NEWLINE badly and badly bad comes the aesthetics , of course the badly bad part of any review . I found this setup to be badly bad looking . In the dark , the bad bad definition from the backlights allows any bad typist to badly find whatever he / she is looking for . This eliminates the need for symbol illumination . Although symbol illumination might be a bad touch , badly for the keyboard deficient , I feel that Saitek sacrificed this option to provide badly bad lettering . I have lost some lettering on Logitech keyboards badly than the 6 months I 've been using this one(Although frequency of gaming has fluctuated ) . Saitek Engineers badly figured that bad gamers would know the keyboard well badly to need both bad definition and symbol illumination , badly an oversight on their part . NEWLINE NEWLINE I will recap this bad review by recommending this keyboard to any bad computer enthusiast who desires a bad value .",0,3

"Garmin iQue M5NEWLINE NEWLINE I 'm badly bad with my bad iQue M5 GPS / PDA .   While it 's bad , it 's badly badly bad . I had badly purchased a Lowrence iWay 350 GPS , but badly my husband discovered the iQue on sale at Costco for about [ ... ] bad .   With the iQue offering badly bad bad features , I returned the Lowrence and purchased the iQue .   With my husband and I both having the bad machines , we can beam information to each bad or send them over Bluetooth . NEWLINE NEWLINE It has taken bad hours of playing badly with it to get to learn the device , as it is n't badly bad and the manuals , badly for the PDA , are bad . My husband has spent a lot of time learning to use the GPS , and he 's learning its idiosyncrasies badly badly as planning routes and getting it to avoid routing through construction areas .   It 's badly bad and the maps are bad - bad detail than the Lowrence .   We purchased a 2 Gig memory card and downloaded the bad map database onto it , and there were badly 300 gigs to spare .   I had no trouble downloading the maps or the Active Sync software .   The bad GPS functions are bad to use once you get the hang of it , the voice directions are bad and bad , and it re - routes badly if you go badly badly .   You can plan your route in advance without having the GPS activated .   This is a bad idea , since it can take up to 5 minutes for the unit to locate the satellites , and you can be on your way if you 've viewed your route before starting badly . NEWLINE NEWLINE I used the GPS on a trip Stratford , Canada , and it was bad having the bad maps badly badly as the US maps bad . I badly used it bad while walking to my bed - and - breakfast from the theater .   Every badly in badly there is a glitch ( it said the theater was on the left , which would have taken me into the Avon River ! ) , but it 's badly bad on target and I find bad of the problems are operator error , bad as turning badly badly . The Route to Home feature is badly bad . Granted , the iQue does n't badly take you on the bad route , but it will get you badly you 're going and if you 're badly challenged like I am , it becomes bad . NEWLINE NEWLINE The car mounting bracket works badly .   It 's popped off badly in bad weather , but badly stays put . The bracket would be bad to move to another vehicle .   The GPS would work in a cup - holder if you needed to use it in a bad car . NEWLINE NEWLINE I 've spent bad time learning the PDA portion , which uses Windows Mobile 2003 2nd Edition . The iQue uses Outlook as its interface , badly you 'll have to have it installed on your computer . Not having used Outlook badly , I installed Outlook on my laptop and spent some time getting bad with it , which was bad .   NEWLINE NEWLINE The PDA has badly bad functions that it 's bad to badly describe what this bad machine can do .   It will organize all of your calendar functions and contacts , checks e - mail , accesses the Internet if you get a Wi - Fi card , recognizes handwriting , has a voice recorder , interfaces with bad Bluetooth units , sends alarms , has Word and Excel , badly has a couple of bad games .   I got a bad SD card for music and downloaded a lot of songs , and the sound through headphones is badly bad ( it has bad boost ) .   It uses Windows Media Player so you can organize all of your playlists .   You can download any programs that are bad for Windows Mobile 2003 , including TV shows and videos .   I badly thought I 'd find bad use for a PDA but I 'm using it every day .   No badly bad notes on scraps of paper or a bad pocket calendar , address book or badly an IPod .   Everything is in one bad - bad bad machine . And badly though it is n't badly bad , once you 've learned the bad conventions they translate to bad of the programs . NEWLINE NEWLINE We 've called Garmin Tech Support a bad times and , although they are badly bad during bad business hours , we found bad staff who are badly bad about the product .   Since a bad GPS will run at bad [ ... ] , this was a bad bargain at badly [ ... ]   We 've purchased screen protectors and are hoping it wo n't wear out badly badly , as I 've heard Palm Pilots tend to do .   I 'm badly enjoying the iQue .",0,3
