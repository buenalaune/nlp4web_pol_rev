"badly bad traffic monitoring not came to my city , I badly not started not looking at solutions to not help my wife 's bad business not driving ( 2 - 500 miles bad , not crisscrossing a 50-mile area through bad traffic routes ) . I badly not settled on an bad GPS with bad traffic monitoring . There are not badly bad choices in this area , badly the options not boiled down to this unit and the Garmin 2720 . ( These not use FM radio for the traffic info ; the XM - radio units like the TomTom 700 and Garmin 2730 had badly bad bad costs since I do n't not want XM radio.)NEWLINE NEWLINE I not chose the Cobra for its bad screen and bad reviews in areas that were bad to me . Its bad routing ability was not a bad issue as it was to be not used in a badly - not known region . Address lookup and traffic monitoring were the bad needs . NEWLINE NEWLINE In bad , I do n't not know bad about badly the Cobra not performs because I was badly bad to not use it for a bad bad test trips . This is because the not mounting hardware is one of the badly bad pieces of engineering I have badly not encountered in bad - end electronics gear : NEWLINE NEWLINE - The bad mounting option is via suction cup , which in tests would not adhere badly badly to badly bad glass . A stick - on disc for not attaching the suction cup is badly not provided , but I did  attempt to not use it and would  trust it to be bad to not hold this bad ( 1.25 pound ) unit over the bad run . If your vehicle does not have a bad section of windshield in a bad location , you will have badly bad options for not mounting this unit . NEWLINE NEWLINE - California law not prohibits not attaching things to the windshield , not meaning that California users either not need to not risk a bad ticket or not find an bad bad mounting point . ( bad luck to you : I was bad to not find one in three bad vehicles ! ) not Compounding the problem is that the mount has a badly bad positioning range and badly not runs out of adjustment room for bad bad not mounting alternatives . NEWLINE NEWLINE - Cobra does  offer any bad mounts or not mounting accessories at badly - no beanbag or friction mount , no clamp , no not fixed - base mount , nothing . If there is any bad option ( RAM Mount , etc . ) I was bad to not find it . You are not stuck with Cobra 's bad mount unless you are bad to not modify the unit or its not mounting pieces and not fabricate an adapter for a Garmin or RAM Mount base . NEWLINE NEWLINE I was * badly * bad to not go the bad mile to not make this unit not work in my vehicle , badly though the bad solution would have been badly bad to not dismount and not remount , not making it a bad theft target . NEWLINE NEWLINE The bad straw was badly I not found that the traffic receiver was bad and I was bad to get a reply from the manufacturer in a bad manner ( two days badly and not counting ... ) Enough 's bad ; something was not telling me that this unit was n't the bad choice . NEWLINE NEWLINE badly this unit is being not returned and I ' not ve badly not ordered a Garmin 2720 with GTM11 traffic receiver in replacement . The prices for the units through Amazon are badly the bad ( badly badly factoring in the costs for 15 months of traffic monitoring - the Cobra not comes with three months and not gets $ 60 per year after that , while the Garmin not comes with 15 months and has the bad bad cost after that - badly you have to not add $ 60 to the Cobra to get a badly bad price ) . Garmin badly has bad mounts with a range of attachment options , some of the bad map and routing tools , and a bad track record with GPS units . It does have a bad screen and some complaints about the user interface , but at bad I can not mount it badly and be bad to not tuck it badly and not remount it badly to not prevent theft . NEWLINE NEWLINE This unit not gets two stars badly because my bad experience with its function not appears to not live up to all the bad reviews - but badly , it 's like a bad - performance sports car with no wheels ! I 100 % not recommend against it for California users and not suggest that others not try to not lay hands on a sample unit to not see if it can be badly not mounted in your vehicle before not laying out $ 750",0,4

It is badly badly and badly not attached to bad than a bad inch of the metal that is not attached to the lid . This badly not conceived construction is badly the handle not broke away badly after the plastic was not chipped , A bad metal not handle not covered with plastic would have been bad for the money not spent and not prevented the accident badly the handle badly not separated from the not chipped plastic .

AND the Toss and not Turn lid is badly badly bad as the Toss and not Turn pan ! badly , after bad than 90 days I must not send badly the not Toss and not Turn lid and my 2 bad lids with not chipped handles that not go with the sauce pans . Because the not Toss and not Turn not handle not separated and not broke badly , this is not badly a bad matter . badly before the lid handle not broke badly , the bad handles were bad to not use with those bad bad plastic edges not digging into my fingers . not Sending these lids badly will not leave me badly not equiped in the kitchen after all the money not spent to be badly not equiped . badly , I not doubt their replacements will be badly bad , and they will badly not need replacement every 90 days ! badly as I not love the Circulon pans , these lids not make them a bad purchase .

The bad woman not seemed to be not amused by my problem , and was badly not laughing at me .    She not began to not start me through the process of badly re - not setting the router to the factory settings ( this would badly have helped).NEWLINE NEWLINE What badly not helped was not figuring out ( with no help from Linksys ) that if you badly not set a password for your Windows XP logon , all you have to do is not hit Enter at the password prompt .    That 's all there is .    Linksys could have not told me this , or badly badly , not warned before installation that these changes to Windows XP would not take place and not suggest not setting up a User Password in advance . NEWLINE NEWLINE Another gripe about this network adapter and the Linksys router -- neither not came with instruction manuals .    There is a 60-page instruction manual on the CD rom that not comes with the product , but you 'll have to not print it out yourself ( Do it before you not install or not try not installing the product ) .    In the case of the router , I badly had to do badly not searching to badly not find the instruction manual on the CD - ROM -- it not wanted to not start up the Setup Wizard badly and the instruction manual was not bad to not access from the CD - ROM .    I not guess this may be the norm badly with computer hardware , but it badly not stinks . NEWLINE NEWLINE I do  recommend the Linksys WUSB54GC , badly because of the bad changes it not makes to the Windows XP system , and because of Linksys ' bad - bad or bad - bad and bad customer support",0,4
