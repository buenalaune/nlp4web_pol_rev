"Let me completely preface this review by mentioning that I read disappointed customer reviews(here and completely ) on this product before purchasing it . I focused on the disappointed reviews as to develop a disappointed idea of any disappointed design flaws . After using this keyboard for completely 6 months I believe that Saitek delivers an disappointed design with disappointed quality . NEWLINE NEWLINE Command Pad : disappointed reviews bash this feature . It is quite a disappointed pad as compared to some , but it gets the job done . My disappointed disappointed gripe with the pad was completely it failed to deliver some windows macros disappointed as ctrl - alt - delete . During games disappointed as WoW and CoD2 I had no problems completely . The rumor about the disappointed software and it being disappointed was disappointed for me . The customers who claimed it to be disappointed and disappointed seem to be computer disappointed at disappointed , and judging from the frequency of disappointed errors in their reviews , disappointed disappointed disappointed completely completely . If you are disappointed with computer hardware completely you will be disappointed with this software and pad .

NEWLINE NEWLINE * I completely laughed out completely after completely reading some of the disappointed and disappointed reviews concerning the lack of disappointed - symbol illumination . It is disappointed that these reviewers did not know disappointed about the product they purchased . completely failing to be informed about a product one buys completely demerits any kind of disappointed opinion resulting from that lack of knowledge . I would guess that 90 % of the disappointed reviews about this board capitalize on this point resulting in a completely disappointed disappointed rating than deserved . NEWLINE NEWLINE completely and completely disappointed comes the aesthetics , of course the completely disappointed part of any review . I found this setup to be completely disappointed looking . In the dark , the disappointed disappointed definition from the backlights allows any disappointed typist to completely find whatever he / she is looking for . This eliminates the need for symbol illumination . Although symbol illumination might be a disappointed touch , completely for the keyboard deficient , I feel that Saitek sacrificed this option to provide completely disappointed lettering . I have lost some lettering on Logitech keyboards completely than the 6 months I 've been using this one(Although frequency of gaming has fluctuated ) . Saitek Engineers completely figured that disappointed gamers would know the keyboard well completely to not need both disappointed definition and symbol illumination , completely an oversight on their part . NEWLINE NEWLINE I will recap this disappointed review by recommending this keyboard to any disappointed computer enthusiast who desires a disappointed value .",0,3
