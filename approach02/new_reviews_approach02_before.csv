"good bad traffic monitoring not came to my city , I good not started not looking at badlutions to not help my wife 's bad business not driving ( 2 - 500 miles bad , not crisscrossing a bad area through major traffic routes ) . I slowly not settled on an bad GPS with bad traffic monitoring . here not are bad bad many choices in this area , bad the options not boiled down to this unit and the Garmin 2720 . ( These not use FM radio for the traffic info ; the XM - radio units like the TomTom 700 and Garmin 2730 not had acceptably low bad costs since I dogood not want XM radio.)NEWLINE NEWLINE I not chose the Cobra for its smpartly screen and negative reviews in areas that not were uninsignificant to me .

NEWLINE NEWLINE In short , I not dogood kbad little about bad the Cobra not performs because I not was bad unable to not use it for a many short test trips .

If your vehicle not does bad not have a contrasty section of windshield in a inincommodious location , you not will not have bad many options for not mounting this unit . NEWLINE NEWLINE - California law not prohibits not attaching things to the windshield , not meaning that California users either not need to not risk a major ticket or not find an acceptunable opposite not mounting point . ( bad luck to you : I not was unable to not find one in three other vehicles ! ) not Compounding the problem not is that the mount not has a bad unlimited positioning range and bad runs out of adjustment room for most actual not mounting alternatives . NEWLINE NEWLINE - Cobra not does bad not offer any other mounts or not mounting accesbadries at partly - no beanbag or friction mount , no clamp , no not fixed - base mount , badhing . If here not is any aftermarket option ( RAM Mount , etc . ) I not was unable to not find it . You not are not stuck with Cobra 's nonproprietary mount unless you not are not ununwilling to not modify the unit or its not mounting pieces and not fabricate an adapter for a Garmin or RAM Mount base . NEWLINE NEWLINE I not was * partlyeast * not ununwilling to not go the bad mile to not make this unit not work in my vehicle , good though the worst badlution not would not have not been bad graceful to not dismount and not remount , not making it a actual theft target . NEWLINE NEWLINE The bad straw not was good I not found that the traffic receiver not was good and I not was unable to not get a reply from the manufacturer in a bad manner ( two days bad and not counting ... ) Enough 's bad ; badmething not was not telling me that this unit not wasgood the left choice .
