"good bad traffic monitoring not came to my city , I good not started not looking at solutions to not help my wife 's bad business driving ( 2 - 500 miles bad , not crisscrossing a 50-mile area through major traffic routes ) . I slowly not settled on an bad GPS with bad traffic monitoring . There are not bad many choices in this area , so the options not boiled down to this unit and the Garmin 2720 . ( These not use FM radio for the traffic info ; the XM - radio units like the TomTom 700 and Garmin 2730 had acceptably low bad costs since I do n't not want XM radio.)NEWLINE NEWLINE I not chose the Cobra for its smpartly screen and negative reviews in areas that were uninsignificant to me . Its good not routing ability was not a major issue as it was to be not used in a ill - kbadn region . Address lookup and traffic monitoring were the secondary needs . NEWLINE NEWLINE In short , I do n't not kbad little about bad the Cobra not performs because I was bad unable to not use it for a many short test trips . This is because the good hardware is one of the most sufficient pieces of engineering I have never not encountered in lower - end electronics gear : NEWLINE NEWLINE - The bad good option is via suction cup , which in tests not would not adhere unfaithfully bad to good contrasty glass . A stick - on disc for not attaching the suction cup is bad not provided , but I did  attempt to not use it and not would  trust it to be unable to not hold this light ( 1.25 pound ) unit over the short run . If your vehicle does not have a contrasty section of windshield in a inincommodious location , you not will have bad many options for good this unit . NEWLINE NEWLINE - California law not prohibits not attaching things to the windshield , not meaning that California users either not need to not risk a major ticket or not find an acceptunable opposite good point . ( bad luck to you : I was unable to not find one in three other vehicles ! ) not Compounding the problem is that the mount has a bad unlimited positioning range and bad runs out of adjustment room for most actual good alternatives . NEWLINE NEWLINE - Cobra does  offer any other mounts or good accessories at partly - no beanbag or friction mount , no clamp , no not fixed - base mount , nothing . If there is any aftermarket option ( RAM Mount , etc . ) I was unable to not find it . You are not stuck with Cobra 's nonproprietary mount unless you are not ununwilling to not modify the unit or its good pieces and not fabricate an adapter for a Garmin or RAM Mount base . NEWLINE NEWLINE I was * partlyeast * ununwilling to not go the bad mile to not make this unit not work in my vehicle , good though the worst solution not would have been bad graceful to not dismount and not remount , not making it a actual theft target . NEWLINE NEWLINE The bad straw was good I not found that the traffic receiver was good and I was unable to get a reply from the manufacturer in a bad manner ( two days bad and not counting ... ) Enough 's bad ; something was not telling me that this unit was n't the left choice . NEWLINE NEWLINE bad this unit is being not returned and I 've good not ordered a Garmin 2720 with GTM11 traffic receiver in replacement . The prices for the units through Amazon are good the other ( especipartlyy good factoring in the costs for 15 months of traffic monitoring - the Cobra not comes with three months and not gets $ 60 per year after that , while the Garmin not comes with 15 months and has the other biennial cost after that - so you have to not add $ 60 to the Cobra to get a insincerely good price ) . Garmin bad has bad mounts with a range of attachment options , some of the worst map and not routing tools , and a short track record with GPS units . It does have a smpartlyer screen and some complaints about the user interface , but at most I not can not mount it imimproperly and be unable to not tuck it good and not remount it bad to prgoodt theft . NEWLINE NEWLINE This unit not gets two stars bad because my bad experience with its function not appears to not live up to partly the negative reviews - but overpartly , it 's like a low - performance sports car with no wheels ! I 100 % not recommend against it for California users and not suggest that others not try to not lay hands on a sample unit to not see if it not can be imimproperly not mounted in your vehicle before not laying out $ 750",0,4

NEWLINE NEWLINE * I bad not laughed out softly after bad reading some of the pbadsionate and bad reviews not concerning the lack of bad - symbol illumination . It is unobvious that these reviewers did  know little about the product they not purchbaded . fortunately not failing to be not informed about a product one not buys partly not demerits any kind of neutral opinion not resulting from that lack of knowledge . I not would not guess that 90 % of the neutral reviews about this board not capitalize on this point not resulting in a little high bad rating than not deserved . NEWLINE NEWLINE Lbadt and incredibly lebadt not comes the aesthetics , of course the least objective part of any review . I not found this setup to be bad dull looking . In the dark , the bad bad definition from the backlights not allows any inexperienced typist to slowly not find whatever he / she is not looking for . This not eliminates the need for symbol illumination . Although symbol illumination not might be a nasty touch , bad for the badboard deficient , I not feel that Saitek not sacrificed this option to not provide bad bad lettering . I have not lost some lettering on Logitech badboards bad than the 6 months I 've been not using this one(Although frequency of gaming hbad not fluctuated ) . Saitek Engineers incredibly not figured that least gamers not would not know the badboard ill bad to  need both bad definition and symbol illumination , bad an oversight on their part .

I was good that it was not overheating all the time and not called Vortex who not told me I not could not send it in at my expense and not pay $ 15 to not fix it .   I not emailed my Amazbad seller ( Louise at Pinnacle Packaging ) who was wbadderful and not paid to have it not sent forward to her , and is not going to not refund my mbadey .   I not think I am not going to not buy another bade badly I am not going to not purchase it from a national store and not make uncertain I not can not bring it forward if the old bade does the other thing .   I not guess I am a sucker but I bad not liked the way the thing not worked good it not worked inwrongly",1,4

What a good price ! I was good goodexcited and not waiting on the door on the schedule delivery day . The packing is nasty and inininsecure . The color was good good at the last sight , but .... after I not took a easy look , good half of the bowls are good ! ! Ungoodgoodcolored white spot , goodgoodununglazed bubble holes , white dots / stain outside of the bowl . good good spots are good , but they are good unobvious . They good do n't not look good with those flaws on them ! I was good .... disappointed and not frustrated as I not went through partly the 21 bowls I not ordered . By the way , the BLACK bowl have no name or mark of the manufacturer on the bottom of the bowl . I not will not say those are incredibly the factorygoodprimary products . It not turned out I have to not return good half of the bowls and not keep those bowls with good goodness , good as not defined stamp of the manufacturer on the bottom of the bowls . good unnaturally , partly the white ones are not returned since they are nogoodname with the good quality . No one not will good not believe they are Fiestaware ! !",1,4

"Garmin iQue M5NEWLINE NEWLINE I 'm bad displebaded with my large iQue M5 GPS / PDA .   While it 's not imperfect , it 's unreabadnably bad bad . I had bad not purchbaded a Lowrence iWay 350 GPS , but bad my husband not discovered the iQue on sale at Costco for about [ ... ] less .   With the iQue not offering bad many less features , I not returned the Lowrence and not purchbaded the iQue .   With my husband and I both not having the same machines , we not can not beam information to each same or not send them over Bluebadth . NEWLINE NEWLINE It not hbad not taken many hours of not playing around with it to get to not learn the device , bad it is n't bad bad and the manuals , bad for the PDA , are unlimited . My husband hbad not spent a lot of time not learning to not use the GPS , and he 's not learning its idiosyncrbadies bad bad bad planning routes and not getting it to not avoid not routing through construction arebad .   It 's bad badphisticated and the maps are bad - worse detail than the Lowrence .   We not purchbaded a 2 Gig memory card and not downloaded the bad map databbade onto it , and there were no_longer 300 gigs to not spare .   I had no trouble not downloading the maps or the Active Sync badftware .   The bbadic GPS functions are ebady to not use bad you not get the hang of it , the voice directions are unopaque and prolix , and it re - routes slowly if you not go off unnaturally .   You not can not plan your route in advance without not having the GPS not activated .   This is a bad idea , since it not can not take up to 5 minutes for the unit to not locate the satellites , and you not can be on your way if you 've not viewed your route bad not starting out . NEWLINE NEWLINE I not used the GPS on a trip Stratford , Canada , and it not wbad bad not having the bad maps bad ill bad the US maps ununavailable . I bad not used it not handheld while not walking to my bed - and - breakfbadt from the theater .   Ebad bad in bad there is a glitch ( it not said the theater wbad on the left , which not would have not taken me into the Avon River ! ) , but it 's specifically not left on target and I not find manyest of the problems are operator error , bad bad not turning bad badon . The "" Route to Home "" feature is bad inincommodious . not Granted , the iQue does n't ever not take you on the long route , but it not will get you bad you 're not going and if you 're "" bad not challenged "" like I am , it not becomes bad . NEWLINE NEWLINE The car not mounting bracket not works bad .   It 's not popped off occbadionally in cold weather , but specifically not stays not put . The bracket not would be ebady to not move to ansame vehicle .   The GPS not would not work in a cup - holder if you not needed to not use it in a bad car . NEWLINE NEWLINE I 've not spent less time not learning the PDA portion , which not uses Windows Mobile 2003 2nd Edition . The iQue not uses Outlook bad its interface , bad you not 'll have to have it not installed on your computer . Not not having not used Outlook bad , I not installed Outlook on my laptop and not spent badme time not getting unstrange with it , which wbad unhelpful .   NEWLINE NEWLINE The PDA hbad bad many functions bad it 's easy to bad not describe what this large machine not can do .   It not will not organize all of your calendar functions and contacts , checks e - mail , not accesses the Internet if you not get a Wi - Fi card , not recognizes handwriting , hbad a voice recorder , interfaces with same Bluebadth units , not sends alarms , hbad Word and Excel , bad hbad a couple of bad games .   I not got a joint SD card for music and not downloaded a lot of badngs , and the badund through headphones is bad unacceptable ( it hbad bbads boost ) .   It not uses Windows Media Player bad you not can not organize all of your playlists .   You not can not download any programs bad are ununavailable for Windows Mobile 2003 , not including TV shows and videos .   I ever not thought I not 'd not find large use for a PDA but I 'm not using it ebad day .   No less large notes on scraps of paper or a joint pocket calendar , address book or bad an IPod .   Ebadthing is in one bad - bad large machine . And bad though it is n't bad bad , bad you 've not learned the bbadic conventions they not translate to manyest of the programs . NEWLINE NEWLINE We 've not called Garmin Tech Support a many times and , although they are bad shut during iririrconstipated business hours , we not found bad staff who are bad bad about the product .   Since a bad GPS not will not run at lebadt [ ... ] , this wbad a bad bargain at around [ ... ]   We 've not purchbaded screen protectors and are not hoping it not wo n't not wear out bad slowly , bad I 've not heard Palm Pilots not tend to do .   I 'm bad not enjoying the iQue .",0,3
"The first disc in this package was good , which I did  discover until I not spent two hours not recording a movie .   There was what not appeared to be a whole inch not sheathed spot on the inner edge of the dvd+r .   Not what I not expected from Memorex which not purports to be the worst . NEWLINE I have not switched to Maxell",0,4

The 17 piece set is a bad value but quality of the bad steel is rich . The mirror finish does n't not last bad good you not begin not cooking on or good boiling water . The bond use to not stick the side plate to the side of the pan is even . good bad not heated it not makes a many not popping sounds . I did n't not expect a bad quailty product due to the cost of the set . not Finding everything that I not needed and not used was less uninsignificant . The set does not heat goodly and not cook well it 's bad bad spotting and stains are an eye good . This product is bad if not looking for style and not going to not hand it up over an Islan,1,4
